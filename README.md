Introduction
Collaborative filtering is a popular technique used in recommender systems. It leverages user-item interaction data to make predictions and provide personalized recommendations. This project implements collaborative filtering to generate recommendations based on the similarity between users or items.

Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the recommender system:

Python 3
NumPy
Pandas
Install the dependencies using the following command:

shell
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the recommender system, follow these steps:

Prepare the dataset (see Dataset).

Import the necessary modules:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from collaborative_filtering import CollaborativeFiltering
Create an instance of the CollaborativeFiltering class:

python
Copy code
cf = CollaborativeFiltering()
Load the dataset into the recommender system:

python
Copy code
cf.load_data(dataset_path)
Train the model:

python
Copy code
cf.train()
Generate recommendations for a user:

python
Copy code
user_id = 1
num_recommendations = 5
recommendations = cf.generate_recommendations(user_id, num_recommendations)
Print the recommendations:

python
Copy code
for item_id, score in recommendations:
    print(f"Item {item_id}: Score {score}")
Algorithm
The collaborative filtering recommender system uses the following algorithm:

Preprocess the user-item interaction data.
Calculate the similarity between users or items based on the interaction data.
Predict ratings or preferences for users or items.
Generate recommendations based on the predicted ratings.
The recommender system supports different similarity metrics, such as cosine similarity or Pearson correlation, and different prediction methods, such as user-based or item-based collaborative filtering.

Dataset
The recommender system requires a dataset containing user-item interactions. The dataset should be in a CSV format with the following columns:

user_id: Identifier of the user.
item_id: Identifier of the item.
rating: Rating or preference value given by the user to the item.
Ensure that the dataset is properly formatted before using it with the recommender system.

Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the recommender system, you can split the dataset into training and test sets. Use the training set to train the model and the test set to evaluate the accuracy of the recommendations generated.

You can compute evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, or mean average precision to measure the quality of the recommendations.
